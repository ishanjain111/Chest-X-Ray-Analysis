**About**

In this project, I have developed a machine learning and deep learning model which is capable of differentiating between a covid-19, pneumonia, and a normal person using lungs x-ray images. Often, we see that people get confused between the covid-19 and pneumonia as the x-ray images are closely related. One might be covid-19 positive and pneumonia positive too. Hence a simple machine learning model will help in solving their problem.

**Algorithm Used**

Build the model using a convolution neural network. This includes using Keras's model. Keras contains a lot of layers for creating Convolution Neural Network (CNN). All convolution layers will have certain properties, which differentiate them from other layers (say Dense layer).  Filters, kernel size, Strides, Padding, and activation are the process in the Keras model. We use five layers of convolution to bring out the best accurate results.
